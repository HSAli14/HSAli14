- 👋 Hi, I’m @HSAli14
- 👀 I’m interested in programing and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the development of computational strategy to identify potential inhibitors using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies. I am looking forward to combine molecular docking and MD simulations with ML and developing ML model to find potentail inhibitors.   
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate with experimentalist as well as computational chemists.
