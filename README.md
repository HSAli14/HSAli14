- 👋 Hi, I’m @HSAli14
- 👀 I’m interested in programing and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intellegent (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) to study the reaction kinetic of artificial metelloenzymes (ArMs). I am looking forward to combine machine learning with molecular docking, MD simulations and QM/MM methods to study drug inhibitors.   
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate with experimentalist as well as computational chemists.
